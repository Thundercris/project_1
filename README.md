# General Assembly Project 1:  Connect 4 

## Timeframe

7 days

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript 
* HTML5 with HTML5 audio
* CSS
* Git + GitHub 

## Play a deployed version



## Goal

* To create a functioning browser-based game of your choice using vanilla JavaScript

## Suggested enhancements

* Responsive design
* Single player mode with the computer making reasonable moves

## Challenges

The most difficult aspect of this game is the win condition, since the whole board must be checked for for pieces in a row in any direction, including diagonals, after each move. If attempting the single player game, the logic to decide which square to play is similarly challenging.
