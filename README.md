## Goal

* To create a functioning browser-based game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I chose Connect 4 because it is a game that I really like and I wanted to challenge myself, in fact, one of the most difficult aspects of this game is the win condition, since to determine if the player won the entire grid needs to be checked. 

## Game Instruction

**Controls**

* Using the cursor, click to select the column where you want to insert the disc.

**Play mode**

* Single-player mode with the computer making moves.
* The disc will always occupy to lowest available space in the grid.
* The first player making 4 discs with the same color in a row wins.
* The 4 discs can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

## Challenges

* The win condition, as the entire grid needs to be checked after each move in order to verify if the choice made was a winning move.
* Occupy the last cell available on the selected column.

## Wins

* Verify the win condition on the whole grid.
* Restart the page after verifying the winning move.
* Make the disc occupy the last available space beside which cell was selected in the column.

## Future features

* Button to restart the game.
* Adding additional sounds based on winning or losing the game.
